This repository stores lecture notes for a lecture series on Bayesian Data Analysis techniques common in Gravitational Wave data analysis.
These lectures were given at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in the fall of 2021.

Topics include: ([syllabus])(pi-data-analysis-syllabus.pdf))
  * Conditional Probabilities, Bayes Theorem, and Stationary Gaussian Noise
  * Parameter Estimation and Informafion Theory
  * Searches and Likelihood Ratio Tests
  * Bayesian Model Selection (between Signal Models)
